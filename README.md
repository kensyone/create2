# ðŸš€ Precompute ERC-20 Token Addresses with CREATE2

Are you launching an ERC-20 token and want to **precompute its contract address** before deployment? With the power of **CREATE2**, I can help you predict the exact address where your token will be deployed, even before it hits the blockchain! This is especially useful for tokens that want to start with a specific address prefix, like the popular `0x69` for Pepe-inspired tokens.

## Why Use CREATE2?

- **Predictable Addresses**: Compute the exact address of your token contract before deploying it.
- **Branding**: Secure addresses that align with your token's branding (e.g., `0x69` for meme tokens).
- **Gas Efficiency**: Deploy contracts at precomputed addresses without worrying about address collisions.

## What I Offer

1. **Custom ERC-20 Token Contract**:
   - Built using **OpenZeppelin's ERC-20 implementation** for security and reliability.
   - Fully customizable: set your token's `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, and `initial supply`.
   - Includes ownership control for minting and administrative functions.

2. **CREATE2 Factory Contract**:
   - A factory contract that uses the **CREATE2 opcode** to deploy your token at a precomputed address.
   - Generate the deployment address **off-chain** or **on-chain** before deploying.
   - Deploy your token with a unique `salt` to ensure deterministic address generation.

## Example Use Case: Meme Tokens Starting with `0x69`

Want your token to start with the iconic `0x69` prefix? Here's how I can help:
- Generate a `salt` that results in an address starting with `0x69`.
- Deploy your token at the precomputed address, ensuring it aligns with your branding.
